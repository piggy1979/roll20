Phillys Roll 20 Scripts
=======================

Mob Importer
------------
First you need to create a macro that is used to fire the script when needed. Make a macro its name can be what you want. I call mine Mob-Importer

Then in the macro itself use this

!CreateMob ?{ShowSkills}

I set these so they are on my bar but thats up to you. 

To import a mob these are the steps.

  * Create a token
  * Next go to the Pathfinder PRD (the offical one) and copy the stat block.
  * Copy paste the stat block into the game master notes field on the token itself. You will know if this works if its perfectly readible. If things look scattered it means you copied to much. Just copy from the mob name to the end of the stat block itself you do not want any of the description.
  * Now hit the createmob macro button you created for this script. You can hit n for skills if u want to save space.
  * HP AC and Movement will appear above its head along with the monsters name.
  * click off the creature then back on to see the macros automatically created for it. 
  * Next you will have a new character in your character and handouts page. You can archive this new character which will be the name of the mob.
  * 

**Note: You can also use the hero lab basic text output for this as well**
